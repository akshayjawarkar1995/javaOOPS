/*1. Inheritance
	a. It is one of the Oops principle where one class acquires properties of another class with
		the help of 'extends' keywords is called Inheritance.
	b. The class from where properties are acquiring/inheriting is called super class.
	c. The class too where properties are inherited/delivered is called sub class.
	d. Inheritance takes place between 2 or more than 2 classes.
	
	Inheritance is classified into 4 types:
		1. Singlelevel Inheritance
		2. Multilevel Inheritance
		3. Multiple Inheritance 
		4. hierarchical inheritance

		1. Single level Inheritance:
			a. It is an operation where inheritance takes place between 2 classes.
			b To perform singlelevel inheritance only 2 classes are mandatory.

		2. Multilevel Inheritance:
			a. Multilevel Inheritance takes place between 3 or more than 3 classes.
			b. In Multilevel Inheritance 1 sub class acquires properties of another super class & that
				class acquires properties of another super class & phenomenon continuous.

		3. Multiple Inheritance:
			a. 1 subclass acquiring properties of 2 super classes at the same time is known as Multiple
				Inheritance.
			b. Java doesn't support Multiple Inheritance using class because of diamond ambiguity
				problem.
			c. By using interface we can achieve Multiple Inheritance.
				Note: object class is the super most class in java

		4. Hierarchical Inheritance:
			a. Multiple sub classes can acquire properties of 1 super class is known as hierarchical
			Inheritance.*/

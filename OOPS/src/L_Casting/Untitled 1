Casting :
a) Converting one type of information into another type is called casting
b. In java casting is classified into 2 types:
1. Primitive casting
2. Non-primitive casting

1. Primitive-casting:
a. Converting one data type of information into another data type is called casting
b. Primitive-casting is classified into 2 types:
1. implicit casting
2. explicit casting

1. implicit casting:
a. Converting lower data type info into higher data type info is called implicit casting.
b. implicit casting is also called widning casting, where memory size goes on increasing,

2. explicit casting:
a. Converting higher data type info into lower data type info is called explicit casting.
b. explicit casting is also called narrowing casting, where memory size goes on decresing.
In explicit casting data loss takes place


Non-primitive-casting

a. Converting one type of class into another type of class is called non-primitive.
Non-primitive is classified into 2 types:
 * 1. up casting
 2. down casting
1. up casting:
a. Assigning subclass property into superclass is called up casting.
b. Before performing upcasting 1st we need to perform inheritance operation.
c. After performing inheritance, the property which are present inside superclass comes
into subclass.
a. In the subclass programmer can declare new properties.
b. At the time of upcasting the properties which are inherited from superclass are only
eligible for the upcasting operation.
c. The new property which were declared inside subclass are not eligible for upcasting
operation.
2. down casting:
a. Assigning superclass property into subclass is called down casting.
b. Before performing down casting 1st we need to perform upcasting.

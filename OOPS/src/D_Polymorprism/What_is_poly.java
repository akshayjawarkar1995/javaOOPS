	/*Polymorphism:
		a. It is one of the OOPs principle where one object showing different behavior at different
		stages of life cycle.
		b. Polymorphism is an Latin word where poly stand for many & morphism stands for
		forms.

		In java Polymorphism is classified into 2 types:
			1. Compiletime Polymorphism
			2. Runtime Polymorphism

		1. Compiletime Polymorphism:
			a. In Compiletime Polymorphism method declaration is going to get binded to its
				definition at compilation time, based on argument is known as compiletime
				Polymorphism.
			b. As binding takes during compilation time only, so it is also known as early binding.
			c. Once binding is done, again rebinding can't be done, so it is called static binding.
			d. Method overloading is an example of compiletime Polymorphism.

		2. Runtime Polymorphism:
			a. In Runtime Polymorphism method declaration is going to get binded to its defination
				at Runtime, based on object creation is known as runtime Polymorphism.
			b. As binding takes during Runtime time, so it is also known as late binding.
			c. Once binding is done, again rebinding can be done, so it is called dynamic binding.
			d. Method overriding is an example of Runtime Polymorphism.

		Method overloading:
			a. Declaring multiple method with same method name but with diffrent argument in a
				same class is called method overloading

		Method overriding:
			a. Acquiring super class method into sub class with the help of extends keyword &
				changing implementation/definition according to subclass specification is called
				method overriding*/

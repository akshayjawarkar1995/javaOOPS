	String:  String is an object that represent sequence of character.
		1. String is non-primitive data type, memory size is not fixed.
		2. String is a class present inside "java.lang" package.
		3. String is used to store collection of characters.
		4. At the time of String declaration, initialization, object creation takes place.
		5. String objects are immutable in nature/can’t be change.
		6. String class is final class can't be inherited to other classes.
		7. Object creation of String can be done in 2 ways:
			a. without using new keyword ex. String s=”abc”
			b. Using new keyword ex. String s1= new String(abc);
 		8. String objects are going to get stored inside String pool area which is present inside
 			heap area.
 			
	String pool area:
		1. It is used to store String objects.
		2. It is classified into 2 areas:
			a. constant pool area
			b. non-constant pool area.
 	1. During object creation time if you don't make use of new keyword then object creation
 		takes place inside constant pool area.
		Duplicate objects are not allowed inside constant pool area.
		
 	2. During object creation time if you make use of new keyword then object creation takes
 		place inside non-constant pool area.
